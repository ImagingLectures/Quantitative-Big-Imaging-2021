# The QBI Lectures continue with new options
Updated: 2020-03-18

The corona virus has affected our daily lifes and how we interact with people. The general policy at ETH, as you probably already heard, is that the lecture activities will continue. 

In the case of my QBI lectures, I will continue as follows:
1. Lectures will only take plance remotely using [Zoom](https://zoom.us/).
2. The lectures will be recorded and uploaded on the [QBI YouTube play list](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcDfeQH_rVdbu7VooFvWA6F9gctY-UUwN).
3. From next week (2020-03-19), I will also offer the webinar posibility using [Zoom](https://zoom.us/).
4. Exercises will be done individually with the possibility to contact us me and Stefano if there any unclear details. I first recommend to use the consultation hour alternatively send me an email and we can arrange an appointment on skype.  
5. The consultation hour is still offered, with the extended posibility to also ask for appointments on skype.

__Note:__ The above items may change when new directives are given from the ETH management.
