# Communication and feedback
## Feedback (as much as possible)
 - Create an [issue](https://github.com/imaginglectures/Quantitative-Big-Imaging-2020/issues) (on the group site that everyone can see and respond to, requires a Github account), [issues from last year](https://github.com/kmader/Quantitative-Big-Imaging-2015/issues)
 - Provide anonymous feedback on the course [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/embeddedform?formkey=dEtIX1ZXMzFacmdhRF9mQVpNaWtWTXc6MA)
 - Or send direct email (slightly less anonymous feedback) to [Anders](mailto:anders.kaestner@psi.ch)

## Slack
For communicating, discussions, asking questions, and everything, we will be trying out Slack this year. You can sign up under the following [link](https://join.slack.com/t/imaginglectures/shared_invite/zt-crg9qhyb-4Bw4RSdw4D7vFmJ3N~T56w). It isn't mandatory, but it seems to be an effective way to engage collaboratively [How scientists use slack](http://www.nature.com/news/how-scientists-use-slack-1.21228)
